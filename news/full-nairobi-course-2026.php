						<div class="content text">
							<p>Cylander is thrilled to announce the second edition of its free certified cyber security course, this time expanding to Nairobi, Kenya. After the outstanding success of the first cohort in Mombasa, which saw a large group of students earn their HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist credential, Cylander and its partners are ready to take the next step and bring this life-changing programme to Kenya's capital.</p>
							<h2>A proven programme, a new city</h2>
							<p>The first edition of the course demonstrated that free, high-quality cybersecurity education can produce industry-ready professionals. The graduates from Mombasa are living proof that when talented individuals are given the right opportunity, they deliver exceptional results. Now, Cylander aims to replicate and build on that success in Nairobi, reaching a new pool of aspiring cybersecurity professionals.</p>
							<p>The programme will once again offer a comprehensive one-year curriculum leading to the HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist certification. Students will benefit from a combination of virtual and onsite sessions, hands-on labs, real-world scenarios, and mentorship from experienced professionals.</p>
							<h2>How to apply</h2>
							<p>Cylander will release the application form in the coming months. Candidates are encouraged to keep an eye on our website and social media channels for the official announcement. The selection process will consist of interviews scheduled for the end of July 2026, where candidates will have the opportunity to demonstrate their motivation, aptitude, and commitment to a career in cybersecurity.</p>
							<p>The programme is set to officially kick off in the beginning of August 2026. As with the first edition, the course is completely free of charge for selected participants.</p>
							<h2>Be part of the mission</h2>
							<p>Cylander continues to work alongside its partners ING, Close the Gap Kenya, and Hack The Box to deliver this programme. The partnership has proven to be a powerful model for creating real impact, and Cylander welcomes additional organisations who want to contribute to the growth of cybersecurity talent in Africa.</p>
							<p>Whether you are a potential student, a future partner, or an organisation looking to hire skilled cybersecurity professionals, Cylander invites you to get in touch. Together, we can continue to make the digital world safer, one cohort at a time.</p>
