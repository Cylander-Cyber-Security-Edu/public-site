						<h1 class="page-title">Cylander takes the stage at Digifair Mombasa</h1>
						<div class="content text">
							<p>On 23 May 2025, Cylander made its mark at Digifair, a leading digital conference held at the Close the Gap hub in Nyali, Mombasa. Cylander instructor Noel Kitonga delivered a compelling talk titled "Cybersecurity: The Threat Actors Mindset and How to Beat Them", drawing a full house of professionals, students, and technology enthusiasts eager to learn about the realities of modern cyber threats.</p>
							<p>The session offered a deep dive into how threat actors think, operate, and exploit vulnerabilities, and more importantly, how organisations and individuals can stay one step ahead. Noel brought real-world insights from the field, making complex topics accessible and actionable for the diverse audience in attendance.</p>
							<h2>From students to conference contributors</h2>
							<p>What made this event particularly special was the presence of students from Cylander's certified cyber security course. Less than a year after the programme kicked off, these aspiring penetration testers were not just attending the conference as spectators but actively engaging with industry professionals, asking sharp questions, and demonstrating the knowledge they have built over the course of their training.</p>

							<p>Seeing the students participate alongside seasoned experts is a powerful testament to the quality of the programme and the dedication of both the learners and their instructor. It is exactly the kind of impact Cylander set out to achieve: building real capability and confidence in the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.</p>
							<h2>Building connections and visibility</h2>
							<p>Beyond the talk itself, the event provided a valuable opportunity for networking and knowledge exchange. Cylander students and team members engaged in lively conversations with attendees from across the tech ecosystem, exchanging ideas and exploring potential collaborations. These interactions help strengthen the bridge between education and industry, ensuring that the skills being taught align with the needs of the market.</p>

							<p>For Cylander and its partners ING, Close the Gap Kenya, and Hack The Box, events like Digifair are an important milestone. They demonstrate that investing in free, accessible cybersecurity education delivers tangible results: confident professionals who are ready to contribute to a safer digital world.</p>
							<p>Cylander looks forward to participating in more events and continues to welcome partners who want to support the growth of cybersecurity talent in East Africa and beyond.</p>
