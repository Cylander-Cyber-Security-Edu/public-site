						<div class="content text">
							<p>Cylander is incredibly proud to announce that a large group of students from its first cohort have successfully completed the one-year certified cyber security course and earned their HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist credential. What started as an ambitious vision in Mombasa has now produced real, certified cybersecurity professionals ready to make their mark on the industry.</p>
							<p>Over the past twelve months, these students have demonstrated extraordinary dedication and resilience. From the very first day of the programme in August 2024, they committed themselves to an intensive curriculum that covered everything from networking fundamentals and system administration to advanced penetration testing methodologies, vulnerability assessment, and exploit development.</p>
							<h2>A rigorous path to certification</h2>
							<p>The course began with nearly 30 hand-selected students, each chosen for their potential and drive. The road to certification was demanding by design. Hack The Box's examination process is rigorous and respected across the global cybersecurity industry, requiring candidates to demonstrate real-world skills under pressure. The graduates who made it through have proven they have what it takes to operate as professional penetration testers.</p>
							<p>This completion rate reflects the high standard of the programme. Every graduate has earned a credential that is recognised and valued by employers worldwide, opening doors to careers in cybersecurity not only in Kenya but across the continent and beyond.</p>
							<h2>A model that works</h2>
							<p>The success of this first cohort is a powerful validation of the collaborative model behind the programme. ING's commitment to investing in cybersecurity education, Close the Gap Kenya's local infrastructure and community engagement, and Hack The Box's world-class training platform have together created something truly impactful. The results speak for themselves: a group of certified professionals who, just one year ago, were at the start of their cybersecurity journey.</p>
							<p>For Cylander, this milestone is both a celebration and a call to action. It demonstrates that free, high-quality cybersecurity training can produce industry-ready professionals when backed by the right partners and the right approach. It also underlines the immense untapped talent that exists in communities across Africa, waiting for the opportunity to thrive.</p>
							<h2>Looking forward</h2>
							<p>With the first cohort now certified, Cylander and its partners are looking ahead. The lessons learned from this inaugural programme will inform future editions, and the success story of these graduates will serve as inspiration for the next generation of students. Cylander remains committed to expanding access to cybersecurity education and welcomes new partners who want to be part of this mission.</p>
							<p>To the graduates: congratulations. You are certified hackers, and the digital world is safer because of you.</p>
