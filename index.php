            <h2>Our mission</h2>
            <div class="intro">
              <p>Across the globe, there are thousands of talented individuals with the aptitude and drive to excel in cybersecurity but who lack the financial means, access to training, or industry connections to turn that potential into a career. At the same time, the cybersecurity industry faces a critical shortage of over 3.5 million professionals worldwide. Cylander exists to bridge that gap.</p>
            </div>
            <p>We identify high-potential individuals through a rigorous selection process, enrol them in a free one-year intensive training programme, and guide them with dedicated on-premise instructors until they earn an accredited Hack The Box certification. Our graduates don't just hold a certificate. They have spent twelve months doing hands-on labs, real-world penetration testing scenarios, and professional mentorship, giving them a solid foundation to immediately contribute and continue growing within any organisation.</p>
            <p>Cylander is more than a training programme. It is a talent pipeline. We find the people with potential, we invest the time and resources to develop them, and we deliver certified, workforce-ready cybersecurity professionals to the companies that need them most. We are expanding across Africa and beyond, one cohort at a time, building the cybersecurity workforce the world desperately needs.</p>

              <h3>Select</h3>
              <p>We scout for individuals who show genuine aptitude and passion for cybersecurity but lack the resources to pursue it. Through a structured interview and assessment process, we hand-select candidates who demonstrate the curiosity, problem-solving ability, and commitment needed to succeed. Our first cohort started with nearly 30 candidates carefully chosen from a large pool of applicants.</p>

            <div class="row two" id="inform">
              <h3>Train</h3>
              <p>Selected students enter a free, intensive one-year programme led by a dedicated on-premise instructor. The curriculum covers everything from networking fundamentals and system administration to advanced penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and exploit development. Training is delivered through a mix of virtual and onsite sessions using the Hack The Box platform, ensuring students gain practical, hands-on experience that mirrors real-world cybersecurity challenges.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row three" id="train">
              <h3>Certify and connect</h3>
              <p>At the end of the programme, students sit for the HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist examination, a rigorous, industry-recognised credential respected by employers worldwide. Graduates leave the programme not just with a certificate, but with twelve months of practical experience and a professional foundation that makes them immediately valuable to any security team. Through our partner network, certified graduates gain access to job interview opportunities with companies looking to hire skilled cybersecurity talent.</p>

            <div class="col-text">
              <p>Our first cohort in Mombasa delivered a large group of HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialists from nearly 30 students, all trained in just one year from zero to certified. These graduates now have the skills and credentials to step into junior cybersecurity roles anywhere in the world. Our second cohort is launching in Nairobi in August 2026, and we are actively preparing to expand to additional cities.</p>
              <p>Every euro invested in Cylander goes directly towards discovering and developing cybersecurity talent that would otherwise go unnoticed. Companies that fund our programme are not just giving back, they are building the workforce pipeline they need while giving deserving individuals the chance of a lifetime. The more partners we have, the more cohorts we can run, and the more certified professionals we can deliver to the industry.</p>
