            <h2>Our mission</h2>
            <div class="intro">
              <p>At Cylander, we envision a world where individuals and organizations have free access to comprehensive cybersecurity knowledge and resources, empowering them to protect themselves against cyber threats and contribute to a safer digital environment for all. We believe that cybersecurity is a fundamental right that should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background, education, or resources.</p>
            </div>
            <p>We envision a world where people are aware of the risks posed by cyber threats and are equipped with the knowledge and tools to mitigate them. We believe that cybersecurity education is critical in building a more resilient society that can withstand the evolving threat landscape of the digital age.</p>
            <p>We see cybersecurity as a collective responsibility that extends beyond individuals and organizations to encompass society as a whole. We believe that by promoting free access to cybersecurity knowledge and resources, we can help create a safer and more secure digital environment for all, fostering trust and confidence in the digital technologies that are transforming the world.</p>
            <p>Through our commitment to free cybersecurity knowledge, we aim to break down barriers and empower individuals and organizations to protect themselves against cyber threats, fostering a culture of cybersecurity that values prevention, detection, and response.

              <h2>Range of action</h2>
              <p><strong>Our approach to creating education materials is centered around three key principles: accessibility, relevance, and interactivity.</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="row one" id="educate">
              <h3>Accessibility</h3>
              <p>First, we strive to make our education materials accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or education level. This means using plain language and avoiding technical jargon wherever possible, as well as making our materials available in multiple formats, such as videos, infographics, and written guides. We also aim to make our education materials available in multiple languages to reach a broader audience.</p>
	    </div>

            <div class="row two" id="inform">
              <h3>Relevance</h3>
              <p>Second, we focus on creating education materials that are relevant to the real-world challenges that individuals and organizations face in their daily lives. This means staying up-to-date on the latest cyber threats and trends, and tailoring our materials to address the specific needs of different audiences. For example, we may create education materials that target small businesses or individuals, depending on the needs of our target audience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row three" id="train">
              <h3>Interactivity</h3>
              <p>Third, we believe in the power of interactivity to engage learners and help them retain information. We aim to create education materials that allow learners to actively engage with the content, whether through quizzes, simulations, or other interactive elements. By incorporating interactivity into our education materials, we can help learners develop practical cybersecurity skills and build confidence in their ability to protect themselves against cyber threats.
	      <ul>
                <li>To create our education materials, we work with a team of cybersecurity experts and educators who bring a diverse range of perspectives and experiences to the table. We also engage with stakeholders from different sectors, such as government agencies, non-profits, and private companies, to ensure that our education materials reflect the latest best practices and are relevant to the needs of different audiences.

 <li>Overall, our approach to creating education materials is grounded in our commitment to providing free and accessible cybersecurity knowledge to individuals and organizations. We believe that by creating engaging and relevant education materials, we can help people build the knowledge and skills they need to protect themselves against cyber threats and contribute to a safer and more secure digital environment for all.</li>

              <p>In the short term, Cylander aims to create widespread awareness of our free cybersecurity education materials and gather feedback on the learning profiles and curricula for our three profiles. We will work to engage with the open-source community and continue to develop new materials and learning paths to meet the evolving needs of our audience. By fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness and education, we can help individuals and organizations build the knowledge and skills they need to protect themselves against cyber threats.</p>
              <p>Overall, our short-term objectives align with our mission of promoting free cybersecurity knowledge and our vision of a safer and more secure digital environment for all.
